This is my iteration on the quicksortt algorith along with extra functionalities

How it works:


Step 1: (String to u32 int parser) It takes a character separated asci numbers and converts them into an array of u32 integers

Step 2: It sorts the array inplace in ascending order

Step 3: It saves the sorted array in a binary file in a format of an array of u32 ints

How to use it:
  Requirements: you need to have gcc installed and added to your path variable     
Step 1: run the build file this will compile the source code to a runnuble executable

Step 2: add the numbers to the input.txt file 

Step 3: Change the last argument in the run.bat file based on the separation you are using

Step 4: run the run.bat file
